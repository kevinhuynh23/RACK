    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final project, we selected the [Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle), which contains a calendar file documenting the price point and availability of a listing on a day of the year, a descriptive file with a number of features including neighborhood, price, and ratings, and a file consisting of guest reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is one of the many technology companies that have completely transformed the sharing economy. Paving the way for other crowd-based marketplaces, Airbnb is one of several prominent startups collectively disrupted the business models of traditional industries (Satopaa & Mehrotra, 2018). Airbnb affords a platform for prospective guests to book accommodations with more flexibility and potentially lower price points, and for hosts to list their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project, the audience we are targeting is potential Airbnb hosts who are considering investing in or renting out a property. For people who need extra income, Airbnb offers a self-regulating (via guest and host reviews), free-market solution for collecting short-term market-rate rents. However, inexperienced and longtime hosts may not be getting the most out of their listing and are missing out on potential revenue every rent day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an article by the New York Times, a host says that she grosses nearly $100,000 each year through Airbnb. Despite this income, she still does not feel financially secure due to the costs of upkeep as well as the “slower” months of January, February, and March (Dobbins, 2017). Depending on the location, property size, and other socio-economic factors, hosts may benefit more or less. Additionally, it has been found that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target specific demographics  (Lutz & Newlands, 2017). A weak alignment between consumer segmentation and this host targeting can lead to potentially reduced matching efficiency. By performing data analyses on the features of the Seattle Airbnb dataset, we can draw insights on whether properties with a specific set of attributes bring more financial gain than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through our resource, users will gain greater insight into what factors impact the price of a listing. Since there are so many different attributes for a listing, hosts will come with a better understanding of competitive prices. Hosts, interested with garnering high reviews, also will learn what factors influence ratings and reviews. This will allow hosts to stand out among the many listings, attracting more customers and making more money while maximizing the potential of their listing."
